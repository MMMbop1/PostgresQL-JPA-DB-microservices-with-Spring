# Cloud PostgresQL-JPADatabase with spring and microservices

This project is running on spring with the dependencies Spring Web, Spring Data JPA and PostgresQL.

Before you start make sure you configurate the application.resources to your database.

The current database is running on a super easy table with title and description for Todo.

The microservices will add todo, get all todos, get todo by id, remove todo by id and remova all todos.

Have fun!
